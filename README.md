### Lecture 10 plan

Websockets

The idea is to allow communication between server and client
(especially allowing the server to send messages).

Plan:

1. Starting from a React and Express app
2. Create a view that displays chat (input and log)
3. Get the frontend ready
4. Setup websockets to send messages 
5. Update client code
6. Connect frontend to the server
